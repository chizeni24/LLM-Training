      "“This victory, my brothers, has come through the suffering of those who endured imprisonment,” he said. In a country where the God you chose, and how you pray, can define your class, limit your aspirations and pit you against your neighbor, Jolani sent a very clear signal in the Umayyad Mosque. He is a Sunni Muslim, part of Syria’s majority. Assad was an Alawite. There are Christians, Druze, Shia Muslims, Ismailis and more.\n",
      "Yet the words he chose appeared intended to break those old bounds. “This new triumph, my brothers, marks a new chapter in the history of the region, a history fraught with dangers (that left) Syria as a playground for Iranian ambitions, spreading sectarianism, stirring corruption,” he said.\n",
      "To Iran:\n",
      "He sent an apparent message to Tehran’s theocracy — that their meddling is over, their easy land access to their mega proxy Hezbollah in Lebanon is over, their support for Syrian Hezbollah is over, and gone too is the home they once had for Iran’s weapons stockpiles.\n",
      "To US and Israel:\n",
      "This is a message Jolani will know is being heard in Tel Aviv and Washington, where he is considered to be a member of a proscribed terrorist organization with a $10 million bounty on his head. “Your interests are understood in the new Syria,” he said. An understanding on his part that these are the powers capable of bringing him down.\n",
      "Jolani’s message was also tuned for regional powers he’ll need to keep onside, promising to clean shop. “Syria is being purified,” he said, referring to the country’s regional reputation as a narco-state, saying Assad’s Syria had “become the world’s leading source of Captagon,” an amphetamine-type drug, and criminality through the region.\n",

Other groups controlling territory in the country include the Turkey-backed Syrian National Army and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, elements of which Turkey views as a terrorist organization.\\n“Given the current circumstances, the diversity of perspectives, and the numerous interventions by various countries, there is a risk of losing security within this (Syrian) society,” Akbari said.\\nAlso on Sunday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi claimed in a televised interview that Iran’s intelligence and security agencies had been “fully aware” of the rebels’ movements during their lightning advance and had conveyed “all relevant information” to “the Syrian government and the Syrian Army.”\\n“What was surprising was the inability of the Syrian Army to counter this move and the speed of the developments,” he said.\\nLink Copied!\\nAnalysis: Syrian rebel leader’s victory speech held a message for Iran, Trump and Israel\\nAnalysis from CNN\\'s Nic Robertson\\nAbu Mohammed al-Jolani addresses a crowd at Umayyad Mosque in Damascus on December 8.\\nAbdulaziz Ketaz/AFP/Getty Images\\nIn his long journey from young al Qaeda fighter two decades ago, to rebel commander espousing sectarian tolerance,\\nAbu Mohammad al-Jolani\\nhas had plenty of time to plan to\\nfine-tune his narrative\\n.\\nIt is no surprise that the Islamist rebel chose Damascus’s venerated Umayyad Mosque – not a TV studio, nor newly absented presidential palace, but a place of towering religious significance, which at 1,300 years old is one of the world’s most ancient mosques – to deliver that message.\\nIt was a message to all those who had taken him to power, and propelled his Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) fighters at startling speed across Syria to oust President Bashar al-Assad.\\nTo the newly liberated Syrians:\\n“This victory, my brothers, has come through the suffering of those who endured imprisonment,” he said. In a country where the God you chose, and how you pray, can define your class, limit your aspirations and pit you against your neighbor, Jolani sent a very clear signal in the Umayyad Mosque. He is a Sunni Muslim, part of Syria’s majority. Assad was an Alawite. There are Christians, Druze, Shia Muslims, Ismailis and more.\\nYet the words he chose appeared intended to break those old bounds. “This new triumph, my brothers, marks a new chapter in the history of the region, a history fraught with dangers (that left) Syria as a playground for Iranian ambitions, spreading sectarianism, stirring corruption,” he said.\\nTo Iran:\\nHe sent an apparent message to Tehran’s theocracy — that their meddling is over, their easy land access to their mega proxy Hezbollah in Lebanon is over, their support for Syrian Hezbollah is over, and gone too is the home they once had for Iran’s weapons stockpiles.\\nTo US and Israel:\\nThis is a message Jolani will know is being heard in Tel Aviv and Washington, where he is considered to be a member of a proscribed terrorist organization with a $10 million bounty on his head. “Your interests are understood in the new Syria,” he said. An understanding on his part that these are the powers capable of bringing him down.\\nJolani’s message was also tuned for regional powers he’ll need to keep onside, promising to clean shop. “Syria is being purified,” he said, referring to the country’s regional reputation as a narco-state, saying Assad’s Syria had “become the world’s leading source of Captagon,” an amphetamine-type drug, and criminality through the region.\\nLink Copied!\\nUS \"strongly supports\" a peaceful transition of power in Syria, top US diplomat says\\nFrom CN\\'s Philip Wang\\nAntony Blinken attends a meeting in Ta\\'Qali, Malta, on December 5, 2024.\\nAlberto Pizzoli/pool/AFP/Getty Images\\nThe US strongly supports a peaceful transition of power to an accountable Syrian government following\\nthe rebel forces’ takeover\\n, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Sunday.\\n“During this transitional period, the Syrian people have every right to demand the preservation of state institutions, the resumption of key services, and the protection of vulnerable communities,” Blinken said in a statement.\\nBlinken also said the US will support international efforts to hold the Assad regime and its backers accountable for atrocities and abuses perpetrated against the Syrian people, including “the use of chemical weapons and the unjust detention of civilians such as\\nAustin Tice\\n.”\\nThe US has taken note of statements of made by leaders of the rebel coalition\\nHayat Tahrir Al-Sham\\n(HTS), Blinken added, saying that the US calls on all actors to respect human rights, take all precautions to protect civilians and to uphold international humanitarian law.\\n“As they take on greater responsibility, we will assess not just their words, but their action,” he said.\\nLink Copied!\\nWhat\\'s happening in Syria is a \"seismic moment,\" former correspondent says\\nFrom CNN\\'s Christi Wolf\\nFormer CNN correspondent Arwa Damon, who extensively covered the Syrian refugee crisis, says that what is happening now is “a seismic moment.”\\n“After decades of rule of the Assad dynasty, but especially after the last 13-14 years, we’re at a moment in time where across Syria, you can pretty much say ‘Syria is free’ and you can say that without fear,” she told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. “No one knows how long that’s going to last, but that in and of itself is such a seismic moment.”\\nDamon, the founder of the\\nnonprofit organization Inara\\n, noted the “euphoria” for scores of families that can now reunite after displacement or imprisonment, although the sense of optimism is countered with an equal measure of apprehension because this moment came at a great personal cost.\\nShe told Blitzer about “the visceral fear” of the regime. “The way that this family governed the country by crushing its own population is not something to be underestimated.”\\nAs for the challenges ahead, Damon said while much remains to be seen, the hope is that it is finally the time when the people of the region are given the agency to decide their future “without any of these outside meddling forces.”\\nLink Copied!\\nUS and Turkish defense chiefs spoke on Sunday to discuss developments in Syria, Pentagon says\\nFrom CNN\\'s Philip Wang\\nUS Secretary of Defense LLoyd Austin, left, and Turkish National Defense Minister Yasar Guler.\\nReuters\\nUS Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin on Sunday spoke with Turkish National Defense Minister Yasar Guler to discuss the developments in Syria, according to a statement from the Pentagon.\\n“Secretary Austin emphasized that the United States is watching closely the statements and actions of the various opposition groups in Syria.

Regime troops have collapsed and melted away, leaving a fragile shell of an army to defend the president and Damascus.\\nFor context:\\nThe US has misjudged the staying power of regimes before, most recently in Afghanistan — where the US intelligence community judged that the Afghan government would be more resilient than it ultimately was — and in Ukraine, which the US wrongly believed would fall to Russia within days of Russia’s invasion. As a result, in 2022, the US intelligence launched a review of how it assesses the “will to fight” of foreign militaries, CNN has previously reported.\\nRead more.\\nLink Copied!\\nAssad is nowhere to be found in Damascus, source says\\nFrom CNN\\'s Nic Robertson\\nSyrian President Bashar al-Assad is nowhere to be found in Damascus, a source tells CNN.\\nThe official line of the Syrian president’s office is that Assad hasn’t fled the capital.
